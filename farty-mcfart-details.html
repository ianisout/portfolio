      <h3 class="pt-3 pb-2 mt-2">Overview</h3>
      <p class="mb-4 pt-3">Be it in a jungle, in the office, or in space, everyone's got to make good use of a toilette seat every so often.
        Farty McFart is a character that needs to do so, and he's in a hurry. In this game, the player needs to go from place A (launching) to place B (toilette)
        to complete the game while avoiding environmental hazards.
        The project started with an actual ship but wanting to add a twist to it, I decided to make it silly, so it could stand out from the rest with a
        bit of creativity, with a lot of silliness to go along with it.</p>

      <h3 class="pt-3 pb-2 mt-4">Concept</h3>
      <p>This is a 3D game with a 2D feel to it, where the player can only move as in a 2D environment: forward and backward - gravity will take care of the ups
        and downs. The gameplay and learning curve are easy, the player will control the character through their keyboard's W and D keys or left and right arrows
        and will thrust with the space bar. From an art direction point of view, the idea of the game allows for very different and unique applications,
        seeing that some levels could have a somber atmosphere while others could be lighter and jumpier.</p>

        <p>The core mechanics of the game are one, the gameplay is easy to learn, but hard to master; the idea is for the player to apply precision in their
          controls and feel skillful while flying and avoiding obstacles. The difficulty should be increased level by level and making it harder is done during
          level creation and development, by speeding up obstacles that can move faster and farther, while confining the space where the player can go without crashing.
        </p>

      <h3 class="pt-3 pb-2 mt-4">Game Loop</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Main menu screen</li>
        <li>Level 1 scene</li>
        <li>Level 2 scene</li>
        <li>...</li>
        <li>Game over, the player goes back to the main menu and can start again</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>If the player crashes inside a level, they are taken back to the beginning of that level:</p>

      <h3 class="pt-3 pb-2 mt-4">Feature Analysis</h3>
      <p>The game consists of many levels, which can be added continuously for freshness and more challenging stages.</p>
      
      <h5 class="pb-2">Core gameplay:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Player movement</li>
        <li>Player collision with their environment</li>
        <li>Obstacle movement: avoidance (considering timing, speed, and difficulty)</li>
        <li>Enemy health</li>
        <li>Enemy movement -> enemy waves, through a wave system</li>
      </ul>


      <h5 class="pb-2">Secondary features:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Sound effects: being it a silly game about farts, the gameplay just doesn't feel the same without the effects of cutting one loose,
          letting one rip, passing some gas… it's an easy thing to empathize with.</li>
        <li>Additional levels (possibly endless)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h5 class="pb-2">Polish:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Visual effects</li>
        <li>Menus/Screens</li>
        <li>Content: additional levels (possibly endless)</li>
        <li>Tuning</li>
      </ul>
      
      

      <h3 class="pt-3 pb-2 mt-4">Art Direction</h3>

        <img src="./images/game-details/farty/farty-in-the-office.png" style="max-width: 400px; height: 250px; object-fit:cover;" alt="farty in the office">

      </div>

      <h5 class="pb-2">Environment:</h5>

      <p>The design for the game is 3D. It is important to keep the identity of the game where the player will have a sense of depth by using 3D assets.
        Given that each level can be its own, the environment for each level is a bit of an open-ended question. For the level designer, they can pretty
        much be as creative as they want. Is the player in a subway station? In the doctor's office? Supermarket? Go crazy with it, as long as the visuals
        do not clash too drastically with their previous levels.</p>

      <h5 class="pb-2">Visuals:</h5>
      <p>All visuals for Farty McFart, so far, were created using Unity Engine 3D, with a couple of free assets added from the Unity Store.
        The main asset identity must be the same for every level, meaning using the same player character, Farty McFart, the same particle
        effects for thrusting, and 3D backgrounds for depth. However, seeing that each level is its own, different assets were, and can be,
        added if they are to improve on the theme, e.g.: the jungle level can have more realistic bushes/leaves, a cave level can have more complex
        materials for stones and boulders, etc. All to be double-checked and tested before pushing a new level out. </p>

        
        <h5 class="pb-2">Music/Sound Effects:</h5>
      <p>Background music: each level will have its background music that must fit its design. This adds a sense of immersion for the player while also
        making each level, and the game itself, more dynamic.
      </p>
      <p>Effects: Flatulence. This feature can feel a bit crass, seeing that for most people this is a touchy (and smelly) subject, but flatulencies are funny,
        and the main idea is for the player to hopefully have a laugh with their fun. The game is equipped with a few different sound effects for thrusting thus
        far, but others may be added for dynamism.
        </p>

      <h3 class="pt-3 pb-2 mt-4">Feedback and valuable lessons</h3>
      <p>After having a couple of folks test out the game, I have made some alterations as to the game's difficulty — making it easier and beginning to
        understand how good I got at it by testing it over and over again.</p>

      <p>Updates post feedback:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Decreased the boosting and turning speed, making the gravity feels smaller - later reported as positive!</li>
        <li>Make debug keys available for players (as a testing phase):</li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tap C</strong> to enable/disable collision, with visual UI feedback, so the player can experiment the level without the fear
            of ending it too soon</li>
          <li><strong>Tap L</strong> to skip levels. This allows players to jump between scenes to get to know more of the game - different
            levels and their features</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="pt-3 pb-2 mt-4">Takeaways</h3>
      <p>This was my first tackle at Unity 3D, and while there were many challenges, I believe I did myself (and the player) a favor by choosing a silly theme.
        I had plenty of giggles while creating and testing the game and have gathered mostly positive feedback from people who have played it, mostly laughs,
      but also a bit of frustration for difficulty, which makes for a great way to spend time and keep playing the game.</p>

      <p>Gathering feedback, applying it to the game, and hearing the results back was great learning and felt like an accomplishment!</p>

      <p>Technically speaking, it was a great learning curve for concepts such as: Vector 3 manipulation, rotation, gravity, basic 3D modeling,
        scene management, mathematical concepts, UI/art direction, manipulating multiple music tracks and sound effects, and tuning particle effects.
      </p>
 
      <span>Did you ever really need a escape to the bathroom and found that everything in your way was an obstacle to doing so? It's not a very pleasant feeling,
        but helping Mr. McFart do so can at least be entertaining. Don't let him lose the battle,
      </span><a href="https://i.simmer.io/@ianisout/farty-mcfart" target="_blank" style="font-weight: 600;">play the game now!</a>


      <h3 class="pt-3 pb-2 mt-4">Extras!</h3>
      <p>I'm currently working on another secondary learning project featuring Farty McFart. This is a more imersive experience where 3D movement is fully explored,
        as well as world-building and overall Farty experience. Here's a peek:
